    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-29</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Flash Beacon</strong> (the “App”) handles information.
      The App is published by <strong>Bojan Drenovac</strong> (Austria), operating under the name <strong>Lighthouse Studios</strong>.
      If you have questions, contact: <a href="mailto:support@lighthousestudios.app">support@lighthousestudios.app</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App does <strong>not</strong> require an account or sign-in.</li>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> ask for your name, phone number, contacts, photos, or precise location.</li>
      <li>Purchases (paid download and any in-app purchases) are processed by <strong>Apple</strong>.</li>
      <li>If you email support, we will receive the information you send us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1) Information you provide</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Support emails:</strong> If you contact us, we receive your email address and the message content you send,
      and any attachments you include. We use this only to respond and provide support.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Information collected automatically</h3>
    <p>
      The App is designed to work without collecting personal data. However, depending on your device settings and Apple’s
      platform features, certain technical information may be processed by Apple (for example, for App Store downloads,
      purchase validation, or fraud prevention).
    </p>

    <h3>3) Purchases</h3>
    <p>
      If you purchase the App or make in-app purchases, the transaction is handled by Apple. We do not receive your
      payment card details. We may receive basic purchase confirmation information necessary to unlock content or restore purchases
      (for example, whether a purchase is active).
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide the App’s functionality.</li>
      <li>To respond to support requests and communicate with you if you contact us.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell personal information. We share information only in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple:</strong> for App Store distribution and in-app purchases.</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers (if used):</strong> If we enable third-party services (for example, backend services,
          crash reporting, analytics, or purchase infrastructure), those providers may process limited technical data to provide their services.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> if required to comply with law or valid legal process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We keep support emails as long as necessary to handle your request and for reasonable record-keeping.
      If you want us to delete your support correspondence, contact us at
      <a href="mailto:support@lighthousestudios.app">support@lighthousestudios.app</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>

      You can exercise these rights by contacting us at
